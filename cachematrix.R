## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and so there is some benefit to caching
## the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly.
## The two functions below cache the inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## The object is really a list containing a function to:
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the matrix inverse
## 4. get the value of the matrix inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
    getinverse <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve
## retrieves the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the
## inverse of the matrix data and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinverse
## function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    m <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(m)
    m
}
